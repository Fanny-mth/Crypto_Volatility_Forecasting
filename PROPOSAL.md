# Project Proposal: Forecasting Cryptocurrency Volatility through Deep Learning

## Research Question: 
Can deep learning models (LSTM) outperform traditional econometric models (GARCH) in predicting the short-term realized volatility of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?

## Motivation
Cryptocurrencies are characterized by high and unpredictable price fluctuations. Accurate volatility forecasting is crucial for risk management and financial decision-making. This project explores whether the non-linear patterns captured by Recurrent Neural Networks offer a significant advantage over classical financial methods.
